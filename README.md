**“The Impacts of Covid-19 on Minority Unemployment”**

The paper discusses Covid-19's significant influence on unemployment rates, which increased by 14.7 percent on average after merely using social distancing measures. The pandemic-induced crisis has been compared to the Great Depression. The peak of unemployment rate recorded by the article was in US, at 26.5 percent for white individuals, 31.8 percent for black people, and 31.4 percent for those of South American descent. The paper goes on to discuss how the Covid-19 epidemic will exacerbate unemployment rates, particularly among minorities.

**“Unemployment Paths in a Pandemic Economy”**

This article also demonstrates that the Covid-19 epidemic is to responsible for the increase in unemployment. The writers of this article primarily focus on alternative economic paths that a state may take in the event of a pandemic in order to lower unemployment rates as much as possible. According to the authors, the rise in the recorded unemployment rate might also possibly be due to a significant drop in labor force participation.

**“The Impact of Shutdown Policies on Unemployment During a Pandemic”**

The focus of this study is on the influence of the shutdown measures on the unemployment rate during the epidemic. The report initially notes how they used high-frequency Google search data paired with data from non-pharmaceutical interventions to isolate the influence of shutdown regulations during the limits and prohibitions of: restaurants, bars, non-essential businesses, mass gatherings, and so on. By using this method, the authors quantify the share of overall growth in unemployment during Covid-19 pandemic.

**“The Impact of COVID-19 on Unemployment Rate: An intelligent based unemployment rate prediction in selected countries of Europe”**

The influence of the pandemic on the unemployment rate is also a major topic of this article. The authors of this work claim that traditional time series models are inefficient and that a combination of linear and non-linear models should be utilized to obtain an accurate u-rate. Their findings illustrate that the unemployment rate has risen as a result of covid-19, and they anticipate that the pandemic's crisis will persist until 2025 before it is entirely solved.

**“COVID-19, Unemployment, and Suicide”**

The last article discusses the impact of Covid-19 not only on an economic level, but also on a social and psychological level. The authors of this article observed that during Covid, suicide rates increased, peaking at about 30%. They correlated the data with unemployment from 2000 to 2011 in order to forecast the impact of growing unemployment rates on suicide rates. The article then goes on to discuss how the data was gathered and how they predict that a rise in unemployment from 4.93 percent to 5.6 percent would be related with an increase in suicides of roughly 9570 per year in a high scenario. They also project a low scenario in which the unemployment rate rises to 5.08 percent, resulting in an increase of 2135 suicides. According to the WHO, each suicide in a population is accompanied by more than 20 suicide attempts, resulting in an increase in the number of persons seeking mental health treatment during the Covid-19 pandemic.

**Research methodology** 

Our population sample consists of 27 countries all from the European union. 

We choose the unemployment rate in the year 2020. 

For the stratified random sampling we grouped our samples of 13 countries by region based on the cardinal points. 

For the hypothesis testing we took a sample of 21 countries to see if the population sample mean of the unemployment is bigger than 4.5. 

For the Anova module we took the ages of the leader of each country and grouped them, resulting 3 intervals .We wanted to analyze if the age of the leader has a word to say over the unemployment rate. 

For the simple regression we focused on the relationship between unemployment and immigrants, choosing first a 95% confidence interval simple regression from the year 2020 and then a 95% confidence interval simple regression from the year 2018. For us to see the impact that the pandemic had we thought comparing the R squares of each regression would be the best. 

Then we took the unemployment rate and immigration In 2020 with a 80% confidence interval to see if we notice any changes. 

In the multiple regression we took factors such as immigrants, suicide rate, Gini index, average wage and alcohol dependency. 

Immigrants – a person who comes to live permanently in a foreign country . 

Suicide rate – number of deaths deliberately initiated and performed by a person in full knowledge or expectation of its fatality . 

Gini index – measure of the distribution income across a population, a higher Gini index indicates greater inequality. 

Average wage – total wage bill by the average number of employees in the total economy witch is then multiplied by the ratio of the average. 

Alcohol dependency – pure alcohol consumption among persons of age 15+ in liters per capita per year, we categorize a country as dependent on alcohol based on their consumption per year, if the country has a 12+ liters per capita yearly the country is alcohol dependent. 

**STRATIFIED RANDOM SAMPLING** 

![Screenshot 2024-08-15 205505](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/706fbbda-60f7-41af-b46e-7883a93d4a37)

In the first part of our project, we are going to choose 4 strata, those being the cardinal points where the countries are situated, N W S E, from the population size of 27 countries. Percentually, our subjects are distributed as following, East 22%, North 27%, South 29% and West 22%. We chose 3 samples of 12 countries each, after that we randomly selected the countries using the function “RAND”. 

For the first part of the test, we took the samples with a confidence interval of 95%. As you can see in the first sample our alpha is 0.05, we have sum of squares within groups of 1.255, measuring the deviation of data point from the mean value. Our z is 1.96. The margin of error is 2.46. We can conclude that the results were computed to be accurate to within 2 percentage points 95% of the time. We have an overall sample mean of 3.88. We computed the confidence interval with the lower limit of 1.42 and the upper limit of 6.34. About 95% of observations from the entire population has the mean between lower limit and upper limit, [1.42-6.34]. 

Moving on to the second sample, we chose the same confidence interval, and our results are quite similar. Alpha of 0.05, sum of squares within groups is 1.11, our z will be 1.96. margin of error of 2.18. Overall sample mean of 4. Lower limit of 1.87, upper limit of 6.24. 

Since we have a relatively small population size of 27 countries, the sample of 13 countries captures most of the population, that’s why the first and the second sample are quite similar. 

![Screenshot 2024-08-15 205623](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0be5b2ab-8b7f-4505-8be4-a637889b160e)

Moving on to the third sample we have a more distinct case. Once again, we took our confidence interval to be 95%, our alpha 0.05, our z, 1.96, sum of squares between groups 0.49, margin of error 0.97, and overall sample mean of 5.13. We have a really small margin of error and we want to see why that happened. As we all know the margin of error is computed using the sum of squares between groups. Since in the south region we have only 2 countries that have really similar unemployment rates. The variance in that group is 0.005, as well as in the west region, having the variance of 0.13. This concludes a really close lower number limit, our lower limit being 4.16, and upper limit being 6.11. 

Moving on we’ll raise our alpha to 0.1, having a confidence interval of 90% and a z of 1.645.

In our first sample we have the sum of squares within groups of 1.25, a margin of error of 0.76, an overall sample mean of 3.88, a lower limit of 3.12 and upper limit of 4.64. 

What do we observe? 

Raising our alpha gives us a much smaller margin of error, and a smaller interval 

The second sample is, again, similar, having a sum of squares within groups of 1.11, a margin of error of 0.67, an overall sample mean of 4.06, a lower limit of 3.38 and an upper limit of 4.73.

Our third sample has a sum of squares withing groups of 0.49, a really small margin of error, of 0.30, an overall sample mean of 5.13, and a really small interval of [4.83-5.43].

HYPOTESIS TESTING 

Population contains 27 countries, all of them from the European Union, we took into account their unemployment rate in 2020, a pandemic year, and we selected a sample of 21 from those countries. 

The mean of our sample is 4.36. We have a relatively small standard error of 0.38, in most cases the more data points involved in the calculation of the mean the smaller the standard error tends to be. We have a high standard deviation, indicating that our data is more spread out rather than clustered around our mean. We have a leptokurtic distribution, since our kurtosis is higher than 3. That can be visualized as a bell with a high peak. A positive skewness that indicates a type of distribution in which most values are clustered around the left tail of the distribution, while the right tail of the distribution is longer.

**One sided T test**

 H0: μ ≥ 4.5 

 H1: μ < 4.5 

What do we mean by that ? 

![Screenshot 2024-08-15 210104](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8952ac77-c6d2-425d-87a7-dec48906845e)

ImageWe wanted to see if the unemployment rate is bigger than 4.5 in our sample mean of 21, the average of our population is 4.3 with a standard deviation of 1.7 and a significance level of 0.05. We computed that our t* is 2.55 and our t(critical) is -1.72. We know that we reject the null hypothesis t* is bigger than t(critical), in our case reject the null hypothesis for 95% of the observations. The countries in the European Union do not have an unemployment rate bigger than 4.5. We have a left-tail one-sided T test with 20 degrees of freedom that has the following visual illustration.

**Two-sided T test**

H0: μ = 4.5 

H1: μ ≠ 4.5 

As before we have our t* value of 2.55, our t(critical) is 2.08, and we can reject the null hypothesis if t* is bigger than t(critical), in our case we manage to reject the null hypothesis, meaning that in 95% of the cases the mean for unemployment in not 4.5.

![Screenshot 2024-08-15 210341](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/94fd647b-7f80-48a5-a372-1ca526c23520)

**ANOVA**

For the Anova analysis we took into account the leader of each countries’ age. We grouped the ages by intervals, having the next following results: 

![Screenshot 2024-08-15 210429](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f5a2ec1-6145-44ff-b46e-968ee4c20d02)

The first interval gathers the leaders with the ages 31 and 50, the countries that fall under this group are: Finland, Denmark, Estonia, France, Belgium, Slovakia, Luxembourg, Poland and Spain, including a total of 9 countries. 
The second interval gathers the leaders with the ages 51 and 70, the countries that fall under this group are: Croatia, Netherlands, Sweden, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Germany, Greece, Latvia and Lithuania, including a total of 11 countries. 
The third interval gathers the leaders with the ages 71 and 90, the countries that fall under this group are: Portugal, Cyprus, Czechia, Austria, Italy, Malta and Ireland, including a total of 7 countries. 
Our question is: Does the average age of the leader have an impact on the unemployment rate? Let’s look into the Anova table! 

![Screenshot 2024-08-15 210549](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4237c524-a6bd-4d4a-9fa5-2c2a083f58bd)

From the sum of squares column, we can determine the variability between/within groups, from the mean square column we can determine the average variation between/within groups. Now let’s have a look at the right side of the table. We know that if F statistic is bigger than F critic, the test is statistically significant, it is not the case over here so we don’t have a statistical significance. Now let’s look at the P-value. We took our alpha (0.05), so we have two cases, when P ≤ 0.05 we accept the alternate hypothesis, when P > 0.05 we accept the null hypothesis. Our two hypotheses are:  
Null: There is no difference between the mean of my three groups, in other words the age of the leader does not have an impact on the unemployment rate. 
Alternative: There is a difference between the mean of my three groups, in other words the age of the leader does have an impact on the unemployment rate. 
Conclusion: F statistic is smaller than F critic, so our test is not significant, and since our P-value is bigger than our alpha, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. 

**Simple regression**

For the simple regression we are working on a sample of 17. 
We wanted to check the relationship between 2 variables, a dependent variable and a independent variable . 
As the dependent variable we have the unemployment rate in year 2020 respectively 2018 and as the independent variable we have the immigrants. 
First of all we made the simple regression for the unemployment rate in 2020 in relationship with the immigrants for a confidence interval of 95%. 
As you can see the R square tells us that 10% of the variance in unemployment can be accounted by the immigrants. 
We have 2 null hypothesis and 2 alternative ones. 
First for the null hypothesis if sig f is bigger than 0.05 then there is no linear relation between the unemployment and the immigrants. And now if we have p bigger than 0.05 we can conclude that the slope is 0. 
For the alternate hypothesis if our sig f is smaller or equal than 0.05 we can say that there is a linear relationship between the unemployment and immigrants. 
If p is smaller or equal than 0.05 we can say that the slope is not 0. 
Conclusion 
We accept both of the null hypothesis meaning that there is no linear regression between the unemployment and immigrants and the slope is zero. 
But, we were not satisfied with these results so we figured out that if we take a non-pandemic year and compare the R square of both of our data sets we can figure out how the pandemic affected the Unemployment rate in relationship with immigration in Europe. 
Nex up we selected the unemployment rate as the dependent variable and the immigrants as the independent one but this time from 2018, a non-pandemic year. 
As you can see we have a totally different R square showing us that only 2% of the variance in unemployment can be accounted to the immigrants. 
So our conclusion is that the pandemic might be one of the biggest factors that influenced unemployment rate in relationship with immigrants, the variance in unemployment that can be accounted by immigration being raised by 8% between those two years. 
Next we wanted to see what happens when we take a 80% confidence interval. 
We choose the unemployment rate in immigrants from 2020 this time with alpha 0.2. 

![Screenshot 2024-08-15 210740](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77ccc7e7-9e4c-44ae-b42f-8b7c6917d3b1)

Once again the R square tells us that 10% in unemployment can be accounted by immigrants, but this time we have new inequalities to test our hypothesis.
As a result we obtained that we have a linear relationship between the unemployment and immigrants for the case of 80% confidence interval, and the slope is not zero. 
We also computed the Pearson correlation coefficient: -0.3275 
Showing us that we have a weak and negative relationship between unemployment and immigrants. 

**Multiple regression**

For the multiple regression test we took the unemployment rate as our dependent variable and immigrants, suicide rate, Gini index, average wage, and alcohol dependency, as the independent variables for a sample of 17 countries. 
We took the alcohol dependency as our dummy variable, we categorize a country as dependent on alcohol based on their consumption per year, if they have a 12 + liters per capita the country is alcohol dependent. 
We first ran a 95% confidence interval multiple regression resulting that there is not a linear relationship between the unemployment and all the other variables for a 95% confidence interval. 
Let’s see what happens when we have a 80% confidence interval. 
From the R square we can deduce that 32% of variance in unemployment can be accounted by the presented independent variables. 
The P values are quite large, and the only variable that has a slope different than 0 and has a linear relationship with unemployment is the Gini index .

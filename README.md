**“The Impacts of Covid-19 on Minority Unemployment”**

The paper discusses Covid-19's significant influence on unemployment rates, which increased by 14.7 percent on average after merely using social distancing measures. The pandemic-induced crisis has been compared to the Great Depression. The peak of unemployment rate recorded by the article was in US, at 26.5 percent for white individuals, 31.8 percent for black people, and 31.4 percent for those of South American descent. The paper goes on to discuss how the Covid-19 epidemic will exacerbate unemployment rates, particularly among minorities.

**“Unemployment Paths in a Pandemic Economy”**

This article also demonstrates that the Covid-19 epidemic is to responsible for the increase in unemployment. The writers of this article primarily focus on alternative economic paths that a state may take in the event of a pandemic in order to lower unemployment rates as much as possible. According to the authors, the rise in the recorded unemployment rate might also possibly be due to a significant drop in labor force participation.

**“The Impact of Shutdown Policies on Unemployment During a Pandemic”**

The focus of this study is on the influence of the shutdown measures on the unemployment rate during the epidemic. The report initially notes how they used high-frequency Google search data paired with data from non-pharmaceutical interventions to isolate the influence of shutdown regulations during the limits and prohibitions of: restaurants, bars, non-essential businesses, mass gatherings, and so on. By using this method, the authors quantify the share of overall growth in unemployment during Covid-19 pandemic.

**“The Impact of COVID-19 on Unemployment Rate: An intelligent based unemployment rate prediction in selected countries of Europe”**

The influence of the pandemic on the unemployment rate is also a major topic of this article. The authors of this work claim that traditional time series models are inefficient and that a combination of linear and non-linear models should be utilized to obtain an accurate u-rate. Their findings illustrate that the unemployment rate has risen as a result of covid-19, and they anticipate that the pandemic's crisis will persist until 2025 before it is entirely solved.

**“COVID-19, Unemployment, and Suicide”**

The last article discusses the impact of Covid-19 not only on an economic level, but also on a social and psychological level. The authors of this article observed that during Covid, suicide rates increased, peaking at about 30%. They correlated the data with unemployment from 2000 to 2011 in order to forecast the impact of growing unemployment rates on suicide rates. The article then goes on to discuss how the data was gathered and how they predict that a rise in unemployment from 4.93 percent to 5.6 percent would be related with an increase in suicides of roughly 9570 per year in a high scenario. They also project a low scenario in which the unemployment rate rises to 5.08 percent, resulting in an increase of 2135 suicides. According to the WHO, each suicide in a population is accompanied by more than 20 suicide attempts, resulting in an increase in the number of persons seeking mental health treatment during the Covid-19 pandemic.

**Research methodology** 

Our population sample consists of 27 countries all from the European union. 

We choose the unemployment rate in the year 2020. 

For the stratified random sampling we grouped our samples of 13 countries by region based on the cardinal points. 

For the hypothesis testing we took a sample of 21 countries to see if the population sample mean of the unemployment is bigger than 4.5. 

For the Anova module we took the ages of the leader of each country and grouped them, resulting 3 intervals .We wanted to analyze if the age of the leader has a word to say over the unemployment rate. 

For the simple regression we focused on the relationship between unemployment and immigrants, choosing first a 95% confidence interval simple regression from the year 2020 and then a 95% confidence interval simple regression from the year 2018. For us to see the impact that the pandemic had we thought comparing the R squares of each regression would be the best. 

Then we took the unemployment rate and immigration In 2020 with a 80% confidence interval to see if we notice any changes. 

In the multiple regression we took factors such as immigrants, suicide rate, Gini index, average wage and alcohol dependency. 

Immigrants – a person who comes to live permanently in a foreign country . 

Suicide rate – number of deaths deliberately initiated and performed by a person in full knowledge or expectation of its fatality . 

Gini index – measure of the distribution income across a population, a higher Gini index indicates greater inequality. 

Average wage – total wage bill by the average number of employees in the total economy witch is then multiplied by the ratio of the average. 

Alcohol dependency – pure alcohol consumption among persons of age 15+ in liters per capita per year, we categorize a country as dependent on alcohol based on their consumption per year, if the country has a 12+ liters per capita yearly the country is alcohol dependent. 

**STRATIFIED RANDOM SAMPLING**

In the first part of our project, we are going to choose 4 strata, those being the cardinal points where the countries are situated, N W S E, from the population size of 27 countries. Percentually, our subjects are distributed as following, East 22%, North 27%, South 29% and West 22%. We chose 3 samples of 12 countries each, after that we randomly selected the countries using the function “RAND”. 

For the first part of the test, we took the samples with a confidence interval of 95%. As you can see in the first sample our alpha is 0.05, we have sum of squares within groups of 1.255, measuring the deviation of data point from the mean value. Our z is 1.96. The margin of error is 2.46. We can conclude that the results were computed to be accurate to within 2 percentage points 95% of the time. We have an overall sample mean of 3.88. We computed the confidence interval with the lower limit of 1.42 and the upper limit of 6.34. About 95% of observations from the entire population has the mean between lower limit and upper limit, [1.42-6.34]. 

Moving on to the second sample, we chose the same confidence interval, and our results are quite similar. Alpha of 0.05, sum of squares within groups is 1.11, our z will be 1.96. margin of error of 2.18. Overall sample mean of 4. Lower limit of 1.87, upper limit of 6.24. 

Since we have a relatively small population size of 27 countries, the sample of 13 countries captures most of the population, that’s why the first and the second sample are quite similar.

Moving on to the third sample we have a more distinct case. Once again, we took our confidence interval to be 95%, our alpha 0.05, our z, 1.96, sum of squares between groups 0.49, margin of error 0.97, and overall sample mean of 5.13. We have a really small margin of error and we want to see why that happened. As we all know the margin of error is computed using the sum of squares between groups. Since in the south region we have only 2 countries that have really similar unemployment rates. The variance in that group is 0.005, as well as in the west region, having the variance of 0.13. This concludes a really close lower number limit, our lower limit being 4.16, and upper limit being 6.11. 

Moving on we’ll raise our alpha to 0.1, having a confidence interval of 90% and a z of 1.645.
